# 3 Tier Application

Walkthrough creating an WPF app.

## Exercise

In the EF-ModelFirst_Migrations lesson and walkthrough we created a Blog application with associated database using EF migrations. In this lesson walked through a 3-tier WPF-BusinessLayer-EF application which accesses the Northwind Database.

For homework, extend the Blog application so it also has a project (C# Core Library) to represent the Business Layer, and and a front end (C# Core WPF project). Add functionality to create a new Blog, add a Post to a Blog, display blogs and their posts, and any other functionality you like!

This work will not be formally marked, but it is a chance for you to practice, demonstrate and improve your skills, so you must all attempt it.

Please ask questions as you go! You will be asked to demonstrate your work in tomorrow's standup.
